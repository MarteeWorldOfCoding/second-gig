            Pakistan, populous multiethnic country of South Asia. Having a predominately Indo-Iranian speaking
            population, Pakistan has historically and culturally been associated with its neighbours Iran, Afghanistan,
            and India. Since Pakistan and India achieved independence in 1947, Pakistan has been distinguished from its
            larger southeastern neighbour by its overwhelmingly Muslim population (as opposed to the predominance of
            Hindus in India). Pakistan has struggled throughout its existence to attain political stability and
            sustained social development. Its capital is Islamabad, in the foothills of the Himalayas in the northern
            part of the country, and its largest city is Karachi, in the south on the coast of the Arabian Sea.
            <br>
            Pakistan was brought into being at the time of the partition of British India, in response to the demands of
            Islamic nationalists: as articulated by the All India Muslim League under the leadership of Mohammed Ali
            Jinnah, India’s Muslims would receive just representation only in their own country. From independence until
            1971, Pakistan (both de facto and in law) consisted of two regions—West Pakistan, in the Indus River basin
            in the northwestern portion of the Indian subcontinent, and East Pakistan, located more than 1,000 miles
            (1,600 km) to the east in the vast delta of the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system. In response to grave
            internal political problems that erupted in civil war in 1971, East Pakistan was proclaimed the independent
            country of Bangladesh.
            <br>Yet, politically and culturally, Pakistan has struggled to define itself. Established as a parliamentary
            democracy that espoused secular ideas, the country has experienced repeated military coups, and
            religion—that is to say, adherence to the values of Sunni Islam—has increasingly become a standard by which
            political leaders are measured. In addition, parts of northern Pakistan—particularly the areas of Khyber
            Pakhtunkhwa formerly designated as Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)—have become a haven for
            members of several militant Islamist groups, including the Taliban of neighbouring Afghanistan since the
            2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. In various parts of the country, instances of ethnic, religious, and
            social conflict have flared up from time to time, often rendering those areas virtually ungovernable by the
            central authorities, and acts of violence against religious minorities have increased.
            <br>
            At the time of partition in 1947, as many as 10 million Muslim refugees fled their homes in India and sought
            refuge in Pakistan—about 8 million in West Pakistan. Virtually an equal number of Hindus and Sikhs were
            uprooted from their land and familiar surroundings in what became Pakistan, and they fled to India. Unlike
            the earlier migrations, which took centuries to unfold, these chaotic population transfers took hardly one
            year. The resulting impact on the life of the subcontinent has reverberated ever since in the rivalries
            between the two countries, and each has continued to seek a lasting modus vivendi with the other. Pakistan
            and India have fought four wars, three of which (1948–49, 1965, and 1999) were over Kashmir. Since 1998 both
            countries have also possessed nuclear weapons, further heightening tensions between them.
            <br>
            Land
            Pakistan is bounded by Iran to the west, Afghanistan to the northwest and north, China to the northeast, and
            India to the east and southeast. The coast of the Arabian Sea forms its southern border.
            <br>
            Since 1947 the Kashmir region, along the western Himalayas, has been disputed, with Pakistan, India, and
            China each controlling sections of the territory. Part of the Pakistani-administered territory comprises the
            so-called Azad Kashmir (“Free Kashmir”) region—which Pakistan nonetheless considers an independent state,
            with its capital at Muzaffarabad. The remainder of Pakistani-administered Kashmir consists of Gilgit and
            Baltistan, known collectively after 2009 as Gilgit-Baltistan (formerly the Northern Areas).
